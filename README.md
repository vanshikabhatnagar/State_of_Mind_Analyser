# 1 General Introduction
In this era of flourishing technology, Social Media has become a powerful platform for the public to voice their concerns and beliefs. Among them one such platform is Twitter. Twitter has been a popular platform for micro-blogging in the past few years. In this context, Sentiment Analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics. Across the past few years, as the organizations and governments across the world start to adopt the ability to extract insights from social data, the applications of sentiment analysis are broad and powerful. There has been a clear implication that shifts in sentiment on social media correlate with shifts in the economics of a country and also the common notion among the public.
Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a wide change in sentiments of various sectors of the Indian public towards the government policies/actions. Studying the sentiment of the people on the epidemic and government decisions is very important as it acts as a sanity check for the effectiveness of the adopted government policies.

# 2 Problem Statement
The effect of COVID-19 pandemic is visible all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding psychosocial and economic effects is critically growing. In a fast-moving crisis, as information swarms in from every direction, citizens look to their governments for information, guidance, and leadership. Sentimental Analysis is only the option in this current situation to understand the psychological condition/mental condition of the public. By Sentimental Analysis, the public opinion on COVID-19, regime policies, and actions can be understood. After Analysis, amendments can be made to the decisions taken by the regime policies, and the public can be fortified in such a way so as to enhance the sentiment towards a positive outlook. Not only this but also sentiment analysis will help NGOs and various organizations to come forward to help the people. Businesses can adapt their products and services to match the requirements of the people based on the real-time trending mood of the public, which will not only help businesses to grow but will also help the public meet their need of the hour. Also, this will enable the government to make business and people-friendly rules and laws to help in the betterment of the economy and the market in these untested times.
